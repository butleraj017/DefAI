Description

This pattern outlines a process for analyzing devices on a network to identify system vulnerabilities. By scanning the network, we assess the programs and services running on connected devices and determine if they are susceptible to exploitation. The approach provides a structured methodology to identify risks and recommend mitigations.
Risk

    Devices running outdated software are more likely to contain known vulnerabilities.
    Misconfigured network devices may expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access.
    Services operating without encryption or secure authentication are susceptible to interception and tampering.
    Excessively permissive firewall rules can enable malicious traffic to access critical resources.
    Legacy protocols and systems can introduce exploitable weaknesses into the network.

Recommendations

    Regularly update all device software and firmware to the latest secure versions.
    Conduct routine audits of firewall rules to minimize exposed services and restrict access.
    Disable unused or unnecessary services on all devices to reduce the attack surface.
    Implement robust encryption and secure authentication protocols across all services.
    Monitor and log network activity to detect anomalous behavior or potential breaches.
    Replace legacy systems with modern alternatives to ensure better security practices.
    Use vulnerability scanning tools to routinely evaluate devices for known weaknesses.
    Segment the network to isolate critical devices and reduce lateral movement opportunities.
    Educate staff on security best practices to reduce risks from human error.
    Establish an incident response plan to address potential breaches effectively.
